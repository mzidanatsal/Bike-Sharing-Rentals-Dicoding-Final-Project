# Bike Rentals - Dicoding Final Project Analytics

## **Overview**


---



This is my final project for Dicoding's "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course, where I analyzed a bike-sharing dataset and created a dashboard. In the notebook, I detailed my process, which includes Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Additionally, I developed a dashboard using Streamlit, accessible via the link in the right sidebar or [here](https://bike-sharing-rentals-dicoding-final-project-mzidanatsal.streamlit.app/).

For more details about the dataset, such as its background, characteristics, and file structure, please refer to the Readme file.

## 2. Project Work Cycle

1. Data Wrangling:
  * Gathering data
  * Assessing data
  * Cleaning data

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
  * Defined business questions for data exploration
  * Create Data exploration
3. Data Visualization:
  * Create Data Visualization that answer business questions
4. Dashboard:
  * Set up the DataFrame which will be used
  * Make filter components on the dashboard
  * Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations

**Note: Numbers 1 to 3 are in the dicoding-collection-exercise and number 4 is in dashboard.**

## 3. Getting Started

## [BikeSharingRentals.ipynb](https://github.com/mzidanatsal/Bike-Sharing-Rentals-Dicoding-Final-Project/blob/main/FINAL_PROJECT_BIKE_RENTAL_ZIDAN.ipynb)

1. Download this project.
2. Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter  Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but  in here I will use Google Colab).
3. Create a New Notebook.
4. Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
5. Connect to hosted runtime.
6. Lastly, run the code cells.

## [dashboard/dashboard.py](https://github.com/mzidanatsal/Bike-Sharing-Rentals-Dicoding-Final-Project/blob/main/dashboard/dashboard.py)

1. Download the project. 
2. Install Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt by running `pip install streamlit`. Also, install other necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if they aren’t already installed.
3. Make sure not to move the CSV file, as it serves as the data source. Keep it in the same folder as the `dashboard.py` file. 
4. Open VSCode, navigate to the terminal, and run the file by typing `streamlit run dashboard.py`.
